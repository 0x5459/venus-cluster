# Configuration of venus-sector-manager

`venus-sector-manager` is main body for interacting with the chain and maintaining the sectors. Let's take a look at its configuration file structure.

After initialization, we can get a copy of the default configuration:

````

````

We will break down each configurable item one by one.


## [Common]

`Common` section includes common configuration, which is further divided into three sub-configuration items:



### [Common.API]

`Common.API` is interface related configuration, its content includes:

````
[Common.API]
# Chain service address, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
Chain = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

# Message service address, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
Messager = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

# Market service address, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
Market = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"

# Event gateway service address, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
Gateway = ["/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"]

# service token, required, string type
# Fill in according to the actual situation of the service used
Token = "{some token}"

# Interval time for detecting chain height changes, optional, time type
# Default is 1min
#ChainEventInterval = "1m0s"
````



### [[Common.PieceStores]]

`Common.PieceStores` is used for configuring local deal `piece` data. When there is available offline deal, you can configure this item to avoid getting the deal `piece` data through the public network.

Each local store directory should correspond to a `Common.PieceStores` configuration block.



#### Basic configuration example

````
[[Common.PieceStores]]
# name, optional, string type
# The default is the absolute path corresponding to the path
#Name = "remote-store1"

# path, required, string type
Path = "/mnt/mass/piece1"

# Plugin path, optional, string type
# default is null
# If you would like to use a custom storage scheme, you can write a golang plugin that meets the requirements and set it here.
#Plugin = "path/to/objstore-plugin"

# Meta information, optional items, dictionary type
# The internal value is in the format of Key = "Value"
# Default value is null
# Used to support different types of storage schemes
[Common.PieceStores.Meta]
#SomeKey = "SomeValue"
#
````



### [[Common.PersistStores]]

`Common.PersistStores` is used to configure sector persistent data stores. It corresponds to the `attached` concept in `venus-worker`.

Similar to `Common.PieceStores`, each persistent store directory should correspond to a `Common.PersistStores` configuration block.



#### Basic configuration example

````
[[Common.PersistStores]]
# name, optional, string type
## Default is the absolute path corresponding to the path
#Name = "remote-store1"

# path, required, string type
# It is recommended to use absolute paths
Path = "/mnt/remote/10.0.0.14/store"

# read only, optional, boolean
# Default is false
# From v0.4.0 and above, the persistent storage allocation logic goes to vsmgr
# This configuration can be used to set whether you can continue to write to the storage 
#ReadOnly = false

# weight, optional, number type
# Default is 1
# When the filled value is 0, it is equivalent to 1
# From v0.4.0 and above, the persistent storage allocation logic goes to vsmgr
# This configuration can be used to set the weight allocation ratio between multiple persistent stores
#Weight = 1

# Plugin path, optional, string type
# default is null
# If you want to use a custom storage scheme, you can write a golang plugin that meets the requirements and set it here.
#Plugin = "path/to/objstore-plugin"

# List of miner numbers that are allowed to be allocated, optional, numeric array type
# default is null
# When not set, it is regarded as allowing all miner IDs; when set, it is equivalent to a whitelist, which is only allows assignment to the listed miner IDs
# If a miner number appears in AllowMiners and DenyMiners at the same time, DenyMiners will take effect first, which is considered rejected
#AllowMiners = [1, 2]

# List of miner numbers that refuse to be allocated, optional, numeric array type
# default is null
# When not set, it is regarded as not rejecting any miner number; when set, it is equivalent to a blacklist, which will refuse to assign the listed miner number
# If a miner number appears in AllowMiners and DenyMiners at the same time, DenyMiners will take effect first, which is considered rejected
#DenyMiners = [3, 4]

# Meta information, optional items, dictionary type
# The internal value is in the format of Key = "Value"
# Default value is null
# Used to support the preparation of different types of storage schemes, currently has no effect
[Common.PersistStores.Meta]
#SomeKey = "SomeValue"
#
````

##[[Miners]]

`Miners` is an important configuration item, which is used to define its behavior and policy for a certain `SP`.

 `venus-cluster` is designed to support multiple `SP`s with the same set of components. The specific performance in `venus-sector-manager` is that you can set multiple `Miners` configuration blocks as needed.



### Main configuration item

````
[[Miners]]
# `SP` actor id, required, numeric type
Actor = 10086
````

In addition to the main configuration, `Miners` also contains a number of different sub-configuration blocks, let's analyze them one by one



### [Miners.Sector]

Policy used to control sector allocation.

````
[Miners.Sector]
# Sector start number, optional, number type
# Default value is 0

InitNumber = 0

# Minimum sector number, optional, number type
# Default value is null
# Compared to InitNumber, when this is set,
# 1. At any time, the allocator will not give a sector number less than or equal to this value.
# 2. The value of this item can be adjusted during cluster operation.
# Increase the config value, the assignment result will always follow the description of 1).
# Lowering the config value usually has no effect.
#
# When this item is not set, if InitNumber is a non-zero value, it is equivalent to this item.
#MinNumber = 10

# Sector number upper limit, optional, number type
# The default value is null, which means no upper limit
#MaxNumber = 1000000

# Whether to allow allocation of sectors, optional, boolean type
# The default value is true, that is, the allocation is enabled
#Enabled = true

# Whether to allow allocation of orders, optional, boolean
# Default is false
#EnableDeals = false

#Verbose = false
````

#MaxFeeCap = "5 nanoFIL"

# The confidence height of the update message on the chain, optional, number type
# Default is 15
#MessageConfidential = 15

# Default is 3min
#LocalFailureWait = "3m0s"
````

### [Miners.Commitment]

Generic section for configuring encapsulated message submission policies.



````
[Miners.Commitment]
# Stable height of the message, optional, number type
# Default is 10

#SendFund = true

# Sending address, required items, address type
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"

[Miners.Commitment.Pre.Batch]
# Whether to enable aggregate submission, optional, boolean type
# The default value is false, i.e. not enabled
#Enabled = false

# Default is 5 nanoFIL
#MaxFeeCap = "5 nanoFIL"
````



### [Miners.Commitment.Prove]

The strategy used to configure `ProveCommit` message submission, its configuration items and functions are exactly the same as those in `Miners.Commitment.Pre`.



### [Miners.Commitment.Terminate]

The strategy used to configure `TerminateSectors` message submission, its configuration items and functions are basically the same as those in `Miners.Commitment.Pre`. In actual scenarios, such messages are not sent very frequently. It is recommended to configure single submission mode. When using aggregate submission mode, `Threshold` is recommended to be configured with a smaller value to ensure that messages are uploaded on the chain in time.



### [Miners.PoSt]

Related policies for configuring `WindowPoSt`.

````
[Miners.Post]

Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"

# Whether to enable, optional, boolean type
# Default value is true
#Enabled = true

# Whether to perform strong verification on sector files, optional, boolean type
# Default value is true
# When enabled, in addition to judging the existence of the file, it will also try to read some information, such as metadata, etc.
#StrictCheck = true

# Gas estimation multiple of WindowPoSt message, optional, floating point type
# Default is 1.2
#GasOverEstimation = 1.2

# FeeCap limit of WindowPoSt message, optional, FIL value type

#MaxFeeCap = "5 nanoFIL"

# Stable height of the message, optional, number type
# Default is 10
#Confidence = 10

# Start the stable height of WindowPoSt, optional, number type

# This value determines how many heights to wait for the chain to enter a stable state, and the WindowPoSt task can be started
# The smaller this value is set, the earlier it will start, but at the same time, the more vulnerable it is to fork
# When set to 0, the default value of 10 will be used
#ChallengeConfidence = 10

# The maximum number of Partitions allowed in a single PoSt message, optional, number type
# Default value is 0
# When set to 0, the default maximum value will be used
#MaxPartitionsPerPoStMessage = 0

# The maximum number of Partitions allowed in a single Recover message, optional, number type
# Default value is 0
# When set to 0, no limit
#MaxPartitionsPerRecoveryMessage = 0
````

## A minimal working configuration file example

Let's take the example of starting a `venus-sector-manager` that supports a `SP` operation,

````
[Common]
[Common.API]
Chain = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"
Messager = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"
Market = "/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"
Gateway = ["/ip4/{api_host}/tcp/{api_port}"]
Token = "{some token}"

[[Common.PieceStores]]
Path = "{store_path}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name1}"
Path = "{store_path1}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name2}"
Path = "{store_path2}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name3}"
Path = "{store_path3}"

[[Common.PersistStores]]
Name = "{store_name4}"
Path = "{store_path4}"

[[Miners]]
Actor = 10086
[Miners.Sector]
InitNumber = 1000
Enabled = true
EnableDeals = true

[Miners.Commitment]
[Miners.Commitment.Pre]
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"

[Miners.Commitment.Pre.Batch]
Enabled = false

[Miners.Commitment.Prove]
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"

[Miners.Commitment.Prove.Batch]
Enabled = true

[Miners.Post]
Sender = "t1abjxfbp274xpdqcpuaykwkfb43omjotacm2p3za"
Enabled = true

[Miners.Proof]
Enabled = true

````

This activates one:

- Have 1 local PieceStore
- Has 4 local persistent stores
- Enable sector allocation, whose initial number is 1000
- Do not enable aggregated PreCommit
- Enable aggregated ProveCommit
- Enable WinningPost module
- enable order

An instance of `venus-sector-manager`.
